    <string name="tutorial_memory_description">Memory is a combination of 3 logic gates which are used to store a binary value in them. You can use this to convert a button into a switch or save the position of a crane for example. You will need memory for every bigger logic gate based creation.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_memory_setup1">Place 3 logic gates. Set the first to NOR, the second to OR and the third to NOR.</string>
