    <string name="tutorial_fixes">Common Fixes</string>
    <string name="tutorial_fixes_description">Fixes to commonly appearing problems in the game while building new contraptions, vehicles or just trying to play multiplayer</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_not_moving_title">Creation is not moving/functioning</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_not_moving_problem">Logic seems to operate fine and buttons and switches work. Items that cause movement such as suspension, engines, pistons, controllers, and/or bearings do not work.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_not_moving_solution1">Check the creation is not on your lift! To check this you can place the lift on the ground away from the creation or use your arrow keys to see if it moves up or down.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_not_moving_solution2">Ensure that items such as pistons and suspension pieces have blocks on both ends of them or it will not work.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_floppy_problem">Parts of your creation become disconnected from each other or the creation can seem quite floppy and weak. This is mostly the case when pistons, bearings and suspension have been used.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_floppy_solution1">Use the weld tool! If you place your creation on a lift, then the two separate pieces can be joined together by dragging one piece to the other one using the weld tool.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_floppy_solution2">Bearings can sometimes be quite floppy and/or weak! Ensure that you have an adequate amount for your purposes and your “Physics Level” is as high as it can go (given the frame-rate is playable)!</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_floating_title">Creation glitching or slow-falling when it is off the lift</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_floating_problem">This applies to creations that have suspension on them.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_floating_solution1">You have accidentally made a suspension glitch! Ensure that the part of your creation with suspension is given enough room to move and doesn\'t collide with anything.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_floating_solution2">Consider using an alternative block to suspension like low-level pistons. Try making your steering less complicated and work from there.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_stuck_title">A moving part of the creation has gotten stuck</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_stuck_problem">Moving parts on creations are getting stuck sometimes. It is especially noticeable when building doors that swing open.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_stuck_solution1">This is quite a common problem. To free the moving part, simply place a block on it or paint it to cause a game update and free the object.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_stuck_solution2">Ensure that your moving parts are made with blocks that have relatively low friction. You could also try connecting up more bearings or pistons.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_laggy_title">Creation is very large and laggy</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_laggy_problem">Creation is very glitchy, large or inconsistent at functioning correctly.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_laggy_solution1">If your creation is not a vehicle or mobile then weld it to the ground! This involves placing a temporary block on the ground and welding the creation to that block, the block can then be removed.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_laggy_solution2">Try to limit the amount of complex components used such as bearings and suspension pieces. Sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones!</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_lost_title">You have lost your creation</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_lost_problem">You have lost your creation, accidentally deleted the drivers seat or the switch connected to the engine/thrusters.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_lost_solution1">Leave the world and re-join as fast as you can! This will turn off all switches in your world which may halt your runaway vehicle.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_creation_lost_solution2">Chase after it holding your connection tool, that way you can see it further away and through objects. Make sure to get it on your lift when you catch up to it to stop it getting away again!</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_invalid_checksum_title">A message screen appears stating Invalid Checksum</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_invalid_checksum_problem">Unable to join multiplayer game and/or friend is unable to join your game.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_invalid_checksum_solution1">You may have modified SurvivalGame.lua in order to get god mode. Simply remove the dashes from the 2 lines or re-type the section deleted. There is no need to do this now that there are custom games.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_invalid_checksum_solution2">Alternatively, you can verify the integrity of games files! Right click on Scrap Mechanic in your Steam library, click on properties, go to local files, then click on Verify Integrity of Game Files</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_items_fallen_through_map_title">A creation has fallen through the floor</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_items_fallen_through_map_problem">A creation, some blocks or a harvestable node has fallen through the floor.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_items_fallen_through_map_solution1">In the best case scenario, the object should eventually just fall from the sky after glitching through the floor. Be sure to check if it could have been caught on something.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_items_fallen_through_map_solution2">Alternatively, you can use a little trick! It involves building down with blocks on your lift and placing a seat. Get into the seat and lower the lift to glitch through the floor and retrieve your item.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_player_fallen_through_map_title">You have fallen through the floor</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_player_fallen_through_map_problem">You have fallen through the floor.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_player_fallen_through_map_solution1">Don\'t worry! As soon as you fall into the void, a screen will appear saying, Stop That! You’re playing the Game Wrong. and you will be teleported back to the surface.</string>
    <string name="common_fixes_player_fallen_through_map_solution2">If you are stuck in an object or water try and get down into the void where you will be teleported. If you are really stuck, you may have to use a third party tool in order to teleport you back.</string>
